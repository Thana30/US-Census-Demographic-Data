# DataLovers
 

This project aims to analyze the US census of 2015 to answer the following question:

Does a relationship exist between ‘child poverty’ and ‘unemployment’? Or how can we predict the unemployment rate?

Does the data support ‘professional’ (individual who has a professional job) influence ‘income’?

Does a relationship exist between ‘Professional’ and ‘Income’? How can we predict the average income in counties?
